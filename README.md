# Latin Resources

Hi! This is a small collection of resources I've compiled from public domain and other open sources while learning and playing around with Latin.

 - [Books](./books/) contains a few dozen scanned, edited (and unedited) public domain books.
 - [Dictionaries](./dict/) contains text files of several introductory Latin-Latin dictionaries.
 - [OCR](./ocr/) are the scripts and background on my OCR process for the text and markdown latin works above.
